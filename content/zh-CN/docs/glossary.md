# 术语表

这篇文档说明了一些经常在 Electron 开发中使用的专业术语。

### ASAR

ASAR 代表了 Atom Shell Archive Format。 一个 [asar](https://github.com/electron/asar) 压缩包就是一个简单的 `tar` 文件-就像将那些有联系的文件格式化至一个单独的文件中。 Electron 能够任意读取其中的文件并且不需要解压缩整个文件。

ASAR 格式主要是为了提升 Windows 平台上的性能。TODO

### Brightray

Brightray [was](https://github.com/electron-archive/brightray) a static library that made [libchromiumcontent](#libchromiumcontent) easier to use in applications. It is now deprecated and has been merged into Electron's codebase.

### CRT

The C Run-time Library (CRT) is the part of the C++ Standard Library that incorporates the ISO C99 standard library. The Visual C++ libraries that implement the CRT support native code development, and both mixed native and managed code, and pure managed code for .NET development.

### DMG

是指在 macOS 上使用的苹果系统的磁盘镜像打包格式。 DMG 文件通常被用来分发应用的 "installers"（安装包）。 [electron-builder ](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder)支持使用 dmg 来作为编译目标。

### IME

输入法编辑器. A program that allows users to enter characters and symbols not found on their keyboard. For example, this allows users of Latin keyboards to input Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Indic characters.

### IPC

IPC 代表 Inter-Process Communication。Electron 使用 IPC 来在[main(主进程)](#main-process)和[renderer(渲染进程)](#renderer-process)之间传递 JSON 信息。

### libchromiumcontent

A shared library that includes the [Chromium Content module](https://www.chromium.org/developers/content-module) and all its dependencies (e.g., Blink, [V8](#v8), etc.). 也称为 “libcc”。

### main process

主进程，通常是值` main.js` 文件，是每个 Electron 应用的入口文件。它控制着整个 APP 的生命周期，从打开到关闭。 它也管理着原生元素比如菜单，菜单栏，Dock 栏，托盘等。 主进程负责创建 APP 的每个渲染进程。而且整个 Node API 都集成在里面。

每个 app 的主进程文件都定义在 `package.json` 中的 `main` 属性当中。这也是为什么 `electron.` 能够知道应该使用哪个文件来启动。

In Chromium, this process is referred to as the "browser process". It is renamed in Electron to avoid confusion with renderer processes.

### MAS

Acronym for Apple's Mac App Store. For details on submitting your app to the MAS, see the [Mac App Store Submission Guide](tutorial/mac-app-store-submission-guide.md).

### native modules

Native modules (also called [addons](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html) in Node.js) are modules written in C or C++ that can be loaded into Node.js or Electron using the require() function, and used just as if they were an ordinary Node.js module. They are used primarily to provide an interface between JavaScript running in Node.js and C/C++ libraries.

Native Node modules are supported by Electron, but since Electron is very likely to use a different V8 version from the Node binary installed in your system, you have to manually specify the location of Electron’s headers when building native modules.

See also [Using Native Node Modules](tutorial/using-native-node-modules.md).

### NSIS

Nullsoft Scriptable Install System is a script-driven Installer authoring tool for Microsoft Windows. It is released under a combination of free software licenses, and is a widely-used alternative to commercial proprietary products like InstallShield. [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) supports NSIS as a build target.

### OSR

OSR (Off-screen rendering) can be used for loading heavy page in background and then displaying it after (it will be much faster). It allows you to render page without showing it on screen.

### process

A process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. Electron apps that make use of the [main](#main-process) and one or many [renderer](#renderer-process) process are actually running several programs simultaneously.

In Node.js and Electron, each running process has a `process` object. This object is a global that provides information about, and control over, the current process. As a global, it is always available to applications without using require().

See also: [main process](#main-process), [renderer process](#renderer-process)

### renderer process

The renderer process is a browser window in your app. Unlike the main process, there can be multiple of these and each is run in a separate process. They can also be hidden.

在通常的浏览器内，网页通常运行在一个沙盒的环境挡住并且不能够使用原生的资源。 然而 Electron 的用户在 Node.js 的 API 支持下可以在页面中和操作系统进行一些低级别的交互。

### Squirrel

Squirrel is an open-source framework that enables Electron apps to update automatically as new versions are released. See the [autoUpdater](api/auto-updater.md) API for info about getting started with Squirrel.

### userland

This term originated in the Unix community, where "userland" or "userspace" referred to programs that run outside of the operating system kernel. More recently, the term has been popularized in the Node and npm community to distinguish between the features available in "Node core" versus packages published to the npm registry by the much larger "user" community.

Like Node, Electron is focused on having a small set of APIs that provide all the necessary primitives for developing multi-platform desktop applications. This design philosophy allows Electron to remain a flexible tool without being overly prescriptive about how it should be used. Userland enables users to create and share tools that provide additional functionality on top of what is available in "core".

### V8

V8 is Google's open source JavaScript engine. It is written in C++ and is used in Google Chrome. V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.

Electron builds V8 as part of Chromium and then points Node to that V8 when building it.

V8's version numbers always correspond to those of Google Chrome. Chrome 59 includes V8 5.9, Chrome 58 includes V8 5.8, etc.

### webview

`webview` tags are used to embed 'guest' content (such as external web pages) in your Electron app. They are similar to `iframe`s, but differ in that each webview runs in a separate process. It doesn't have the same permissions as your web page and all interactions between your app and embedded content will be asynchronous. This keeps your app safe from the embedded content.
