# Electron 应用结构

在我们深入了解Electron的API之前，我们需要探讨一下Electron中的两个进程。 They are fundamentally different and important to understand.

## Main and Renderer Processes

Electron 运行 `package.json` 的 `main` 脚本的进程被称为**主进程**。 The script that runs in the main process can display a GUI by creating web pages. An Electron app always has one main process, but never more.

由于 Electron 使用 Chromium 来显示 web 页面，所以 Chromium 的多进程架构也是可用的。 每个 Electron 中的 web 页面运行在它的叫**渲染进程**的进程中。

在通常的浏览器内，网页通常运行在一个沙盒的环境挡住并且不能够使用原生的资源。 然而 Electron 的用户在 Node.js 的 API 支持下可以在页面中和操作系统进行一些底层交互。

### 主进程和渲染进程之间的区别

主进程使用 `BrowserWindow` 实例创建页面。 每个 `BrowserWindow` 实例都在自己的渲染进程里运行页面。 当一个 `BrowserWindow` 实例被销毁后，相应的渲染进程也会被终止。

The main process manages all web pages and their corresponding renderer processes. Each renderer process is isolated and only cares about the web page running in it.

由于在页面里管理原生 GUI 资源是非常危险而且容易造成资源泄露，所以在页面调用 GUI 相关的 APIs 是不被允许的。 如果你想在网页里使用 GUI 操作，其对应的渲染进程必须与主进程进行通讯，请求主进程进行相关的 GUI 操作。

> #### Aside: Communication Between Processes
> 
> In Electron, we have several ways to communicate between the main process and renderer processes. Like [`ipcRenderer`](../api/ipc-renderer.md) and [`ipcMain`](../api/ipc-main.md) modules for sending messages, and the [remote](../api/remote.md) module for RPC style communication. There is also an FAQ entry on [how to share data between web pages](../faq.md#how-to-share-data-between-web-pages).

## Using Electron APIs

Electron offers a number of APIs that support the development of a desktop application in both the main process and the renderer process. In both processes, you'd access Electron's APIs by requiring its included module:

```javascript
const electron = require('electron')
```

All Electron APIs are assigned a process type. Many of them can only be used from the main process, some of them only from a renderer process, some from both. The documentation for the individual API will clearly state which process they can be used from.

A window in Electron is for instance created using the `BrowserWindow` class. It is only available in the main process.

```javascript
// This will work in the main process, but be `undefined` in a
// renderer process:
const { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')

const win = new BrowserWindow()
```

Since communication between the processes is possible, a renderer process can call upon the main process to perform tasks. Electron comes with a module called `remote` that exposes APIs usually only available on the main process. In order to create a `BrowserWindow` from a renderer process, we'd use the remote as a middle-man:

```javascript
// This will work in a renderer process, but be `undefined` in the
// main process:
const { remote } = require('electron')
const { BrowserWindow } = remote

const win = new BrowserWindow()
```

## Using Node.js APIs

Electron exposes full access to Node.js both in the main and the renderer process. This has two important implications:

1) All APIs available in Node.js are available in Electron. Calling the following code from an Electron app works:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs')

const root = fs.readdirSync('/')

// This will print all files at the root-level of the disk,
// either '/' or 'C:\'.
console.log(root)
```

As you might already be able to guess, this has important security implications if you ever attempt to load remote content. You can find more information and guidance on loading remote content in our [security documentation](./security.md).

2) You can use Node.js modules in your application. Pick your favorite npm module. npm offers currently the world's biggest repository of open-source code – the ability to use well-maintained and tested code that used to be reserved for server applications is one of the key features of Electron.

As an example, to use the official AWS SDK in your application, you'd first install it as a dependency:

```sh
npm install --save aws-sdk
```

Then, in your Electron app, simply require and use the module as if you were building a Node.js application:

```javascript
// A ready-to-use S3 Client
const S3 = require('aws-sdk/clients/s3')
```

There is one important caveat: Native Node.js modules (that is, modules that require compilation of native code before they can be used) will need to be compiled to be used with Electron.

The vast majority of Node.js modules are *not* native. Only 400 out of the ~650.000 modules are native. However, if you do need native modules, please consult [this guide on how to recompile them for Electron](./using-native-node-modules.md) (it's easy).
