# 릴리즈

이 문서는 Electron 의 새버전 출시 절차를 설명합니다.

## Determine which branch to release from

- **If releasing beta,** create a new branch from `master`.
- **If releasing a stable version,** create a new branch from the beta branch you're stabilizing.

## Find out what version change is needed

Run `npm run prepare-release -- --notesOnly` to view auto generated release notes. The notes generated should help you determine if this is a major, minor, patch, or beta version change. Read the [Version Change Rules](../tutorial/electron-versioning.md#semver) for more information.

## Run the prepare-release script

The prepare release script will do the following: 1. Check if a release is already in process and if so it will halt. 2. Create a release branch. 3. Bump the version number in several files. See [this bump commit](https://github.com/electron/electron/commit/78ec1b8f89b3886b856377a1756a51617bc33f5a) for an example. 4. Create a draft release on GitHub with auto-generated release notes 5. Push the release branch so that the release builds get built. Once you have determined which type of version change is needed, run the `prepare-release` script with arguments according to your need: - `[major|minor|patch|beta]` to increment one of the version numbers, or - `--stable` to indicate this is a stable version

## 빌드를 기다리십시오 : hourglass_flowing_sand :

`bump-version` 스크립트로 작성된 커밋 메시지에 [`Bump`](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/7961a97d7ddbed657c6c867cc8426e02c236c077/script/cibuild-linux#L3-L6)라는 단어가 있으면 [릴리스 프로세스가 시작됩니다](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/7961a97d7ddbed657c6c867cc8426e02c236c077/script/cibuild#L82-L96).

빌드 진행 상황을 모니터링하려면 다음 페이지를 참조하십시오.

## 릴리즈 노트 컴파일

릴리스 노트 작성은 빌드가 실행되는 동안 작업을 계속해서 유지하는 좋은 방법입니다. 또는 선행 기술의 경우, [릴리스 페이지](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases)의 기존 릴리스를 참조하십시오.

Tips: - Each listed item should reference a PR on electron/electron, not an issue, nor a PR from another repo like libcc. - No need to use link markup when referencing PRs. Strings like `#123` will automatically be converted to links on github.com. - Electron의 모든 버전에서 Chromium, V8 및 Node의 버전을 보려면 [atom.io/download/electron/index.json](https://atom.io/download/electron/index.json)을 방문하십시오.

### 패치 릴리즈

```sh
**Note:** This is a beta release and most likely will have have some instability and/or regressions.

버그가 발견되면 새로운 문제를 제출하십시오.

이 릴리즈는`beta '태그 아래 [npm] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron)에 게시되며`npm install electron @ beta`를 통해 설치할 수 있습니다.
```

## 릴리즈 초안 편집

1. [릴리즈 페이지](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases)에 가면 릴리즈 노트 초안과 자리 표시자로써 릴리즈 노트를 볼 수 있습니다.
2. 릴리즈를 편집하고 릴리즈 노트를 추가하세요.
3. Uncheck the `prerelease` checkbox if you're publishing a stable release; leave it checked for beta releases.
4. 'Save draft' 를 클릭하세요. **'Publish release' 를 누르면 안됩니다!**
5. 모든 빌드가 통과할 때 까지 기다리세요.
6. You can run `npm run release --validateRelease` to verify that all of the required files have been created for the release.

## 임시 브랜치 병합

Once the release builds have finished, merge the `release` branch back into the source release branch using the `merge-release` script. If the branch cannot be successfully merged back this script will automatically rebase the `release` branch and push the changes which will trigger the release builds again, which means you will need to wait for the release builds to run again before proceeding.

### Merging back into master

```sh
npm run merge-release -- master
```

### Merging back into old release branch

```sh
npm run merge-release -- 1-7-x
```

## 릴리즈 게시

Once the merge has finished successfully, run the `release` script via `npm run release` to finish the release process. This script will do the following: 1. Build the project to validate that the correct version number is being released. 2. Download the binaries and generate the node headers and the .lib linker used on Windows by node-gyp to build native modules. 3. Create and upload the SHASUMS files stored on S3 for the node files. 4. Create and upload the SHASUMS256.txt file stored on the GitHub release. 5. Validate that all of the required files are present on GitHub and S3 and have the correct checksums as specified in the SHASUMS files. 6. Publish the release on GitHub 7. Delete the `release` branch.

## Publish to npm

Once the publish is successful, run `npm run publish-to-npm` to publish to release to npm.

## Fix missing binaries of a release manually

In the case of a corrupted release with broken CI machines, we might have to re-upload the binaries for an already published release.

The first step is to go to the [Releases](https://github.com/electron/electron/releases) page and delete the corrupted binaries with the `SHASUMS256.txt` checksum file.

Then manually create distributions for each platform and upload them:

```sh
# Checkout the version to re-upload.
git checkout vTHE.RELEASE.VERSION

# Do release build, specifying one target architecture.
./script/bootstrap.py --target_arch [arm|x64|ia32]
./script/build.py -c R
./script/create-dist.py

# Explicitly allow overwritting a published release.
./script/upload.py --overwrite
```

After re-uploading all distributions, publish again to upload the checksum file:

```sh
npm run release
```
